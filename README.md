### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Anthony. I am starting my coding journey, which is something i have been planning for a very long time. I am looking forward to meeting all of my classmates and potential business partners. Anything you want to know about me, please just ask. Fun fact: I am legally blind. Not so fun, but it is a fact. Your patience with that would be very appreciated. No pets, no kids, no plants.
